This Makefile is meant for a project tree looking like this:
----------------------
     project/
	Makefile
	program (linked executable)
	src/
	obj/
	include/
----------------------

1. All source files in src/ are compiled to object files in obj/
2. The object files are then linked to a main executable in the project root
3. Header files are placed in include/
4. This cpp makefile assumes usage of SDL (a commonly used multimedia library)
