Makefile for c program's written for the msp430 G2231

- 2 KB of flash (perm-storage)
- 128 B of SRAM (faster-storage)

for space conservation:

use -Os (O stands for optimization, s for space!)

sectors in flash can be erased, but contain several bytes
look into "info-mem" for smaller sectors of flash (if you 
cannot just free a large sector)

secondly, write better c.

thirdly, look into assembler code if c fails.

requirements:

mspgcc-binutils (utils)
mspgcc-430-libs (library)
mppgcc-430mcu (headers)
mspgcc-mspgcc (gcc)
mspdebug (debugger & easy connection to dev-board)

quick how-to:

1) get req's above (yaourt, pacman ... or other)
2) compile your file using Makefile
3) look at where dev-board is connected using:
   sudo mspdebug --usb-list
4) connect using:
   sudo mspdebug -U "bus:dev" rf2500
5) Erase the device and flash the data contained in a binary file
   (mspdebug) prog program
6) run program if not already running
   (mspdebug) run
7) you are done!

from here you can debug using the two led's on the dev-board! :D

(or if you want to use gdb and step through stuff, look into 
mspdebug's gdb command and external debugging with gdb (port 2000
on localhost is the default for mspdebug))
