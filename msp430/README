Makefile for c program's written for the msp430 G2231

- 2 KB of flash (perm-storage)
- 128 B of SRAM (faster-storage)

for space conservation:

use -Os (O stands for optimization, s for space!)

sectors in flash can be erased, but contain several bytes
look into "info-mem" for smaller sectors of flash (if you 
cannot just free a large sector)

secondly, write better c.

thirdly, look into assembler code if c fails.
