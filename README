Different makefiles for different languages will be added here

The general idea is that:
1. they should be somewhat generic, requiring as little maintenance as possible
   (adding source files etc)
2. they are simple in nature
   (small project folders with src/ and obj/)
   (feel free to make them more complex tho :P)
