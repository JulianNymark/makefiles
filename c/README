This Makefile is meant for a project tree looking like this:
----------------------
     project/
	Makefile
	main.exe
	src/
	obj/
----------------------

1. All source files in src/ are compiled to object files in obj/
2. The object files are then linked to a main executable in the project root

*. It currently only looks for *.c in src/ (headers can be added with "-I <dir>" in CFLAGS)
